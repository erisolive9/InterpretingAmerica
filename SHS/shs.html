        <h1>Welcome to Speedway High School</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Speedway High School. We’re happy to have you in our school and community!  
            Our school is centered in Speedway, Indiana, USA. The town was founded in 1926 by Carl Fisher, 
            James Allison, Arthur Newby, and Frank Wheeler. They built the Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
            track, leading to the development of the town. The Indianapolis 500 race is very important to 
            the culture of the town because it’s the biggest Indycar race in the world!  In 1928, the school
             corporation was formed, and in the 1960s, Speedway High School moved to its current location. 

            Our schools are known for being small because only Speedway residents can attend our schools. 
            This gives students more attention from teachers, counselors, and administrators. The high 
            school currently has 564 students with a large minority enrollment. Freshman are typically 14 
            years old while graduating seniors are typically 18 years old. 94% of students participate in 
            AP classes at Speedway, and 33% of students are in an English as a New Language (ENL) class. 
            The school system does not have buses, and students who attend Speedway schools must live within 
            the Speedway district. 
            
            If you are already enrolled in school, we can’t wait to see you! If you are not, please visit 
            our <a href="Documents/documents.html">Documents</a> page to learn how to enroll.
