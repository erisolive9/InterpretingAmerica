            <h1>Interpreting America</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our page! We are Interpreting America, a business aiming to aid schools 
                in helping their immigrant students to adjust to American education and to succeed. 
                Our project was started in 2023 by Eris Blair as a project for the Innovations class 
                at our high school, where students create their own businesses. Upon the new school 
                year, Alisa Yarling joined the project after spending her junior year abroad in India.
                Our mission is to make immigrants feel more welcome in American schools and communities
                and to break down language and culture barriers to create more connection between all 
                types of people. Cultural diversity is inherently American: we have been built upon 
                immigration and the dream of finding a better life in this land. <br><br> 
                Interpreting America aids people in achieving this dream in the modern day, through 
                translated information about citizenship, schools, jobs, money, English, and everything 
                that’s necessary to know to succeed here that those who have been born here may overlook. 
                Our project of providing information begins with our school in Speedway, Indiana, and we
                will sell this website template to other schools to provide the same vital information 
                to their students. We hope this service is helpful to you and would love to hear your feedback! 
                Our contact information is provided below for you to do so. Scroll to continue to Speedway 
                High School’s page. <br><br>
